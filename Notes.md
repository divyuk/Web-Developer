Node is a Runtime env while the express is the JS framework. Remember if node is screwdriver then Express is electric screwdriver.
Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It is built on top of Node.js and provides a set of features and tools that simplify the process of building web applications and APIs.
While Node.js allows you to handle low-level networking and HTTP operations, Express provides a higher-level abstraction that makes it easier to define routes, handle requests and responses, and implement various web application functionalities.
